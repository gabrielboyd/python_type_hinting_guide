## 📋 Frequently Asked Questions

### What is type hinting?

Type hinting is a feature in Python that allows you to indicate the expected data types of variables and function parameters. This helps improve code clarity and enables static type checkers to identify potential errors.

### Why should I use type hinting?

Using type hinting can make your code more understandable. It allows other developers (and your future self) to quickly grasp how your code works. Type hinting may also help prevent bugs by catching type-related errors early in the development process.
