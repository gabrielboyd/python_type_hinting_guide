**Modern Python Type Hinting Guide (Python 3.14, working draft)**

This repository contains a working draft of a comprehensive guide to modern Python type hinting, current as of Python 3.14. The guide focuses on *practical usage, design intent, and static-analysis–driven reasoning*, rather than duplicating reference material from the standard documentation.

The document is publicly visible to enable review and discussion. It is shared specifically to collect feedback before being stabilized into a more authoritative version.

## How to Engage

Comments, issues, and pull requests are welcome. The most valuable feedback at this stage is:

* Conceptual errors or oversights in how typing features are explained
* Corrections or improvements to links and references to official Python documentation, with a preference for consolidated references (e.g. typing module specs) over individual PEPs where possible.
* Inaccuracies or edge cases in checker behavior (mypy, pyright, etc.)
* Places where the explanation is correct but unclear or misleading to non-experts
* Structural or pedagogical suggestions (ordering, grouping, emphasis)
* Missing topics that materially affect real-world typing practice


You should assume the document is *directionally correct but not yet final*. If something seems wrong, ambiguous, or overstated, that is precisely the kind of feedback this draft is meant to surface.

## Status and Licensing

This is a public, timestamped draft. It should not yet be treated as authoritative or complete.

The document is **not currently open-licensed**. Redistribution, reuse, or incorporation into other works outside this repository is not permitted without explicit permission from the author. Licensing and attribution terms may change once the document stabilizes.
